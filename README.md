# 🧠 Nine Board Tic Tac Toe (C++)

A console-based C++ implementation of **Nine Board Tic Tac Toe** — a strategic twist on classic Tic Tac Toe. Instead of playing on one 3x3 board, players take turns on a 3x3 grid of 3x3 boards (81 cells total). Each move determines which board your opponent must play on next, adding layers of strategy and depth.

## 🎮 Game Modes
